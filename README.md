# Intro

This is a repository for panel data on religious companies in Brazil. We extract data from the amazing project by George Santiago (here)[https://github.com/georgevbsantiago/qsacnpj], subsetting the database to only empresas religiosas, using the appropriate CNAE code.

We have the following tasks in the pipeline:

1. Extract only religious orgs.
2. Extract only religious org and their respective CNPJ ra√≠zes.
3. Classify each religious org according to their denomination.
